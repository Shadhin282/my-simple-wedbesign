        <h3>My First Project</h3>
        <p>
            The Seychelles, located in the Indian Ocean and known as Africa's smallest country, comprise 115 islands scattered across 541,000 sq. mi. of ocean, each one with its own distinct character and personality. While you can’t possibly visit them all, here is a place to start. The islands fall into two categories. There are 41 ‘inner’ granitic islands that form the backbone of Seychelles’ tourism offerings with their wide suite of services and amenities, most of which are readily accessible through a selection of day trips and excursions. The remoter Outer Islands are mainly low-lying coral reef islands, sand cays, and, in some cases, spectacular atolls divided into five distinct island groups. Mahé Island The Seychelles largest and main island, Mahé is home to the capital city of Victoria and almost 90% of the nation's total population. Still, the island retains its idyllic beauty, with 3,000-foot mountains and scores of gorgeous beaches. Many plants, including the so-called Jellyfish Tree and several rare orchids, are unique to Mahe's shores
